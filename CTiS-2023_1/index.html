<h1>Proposal</h1>


<p>Our chosen topic is "Impacts of AI on Online learning for Students" in Computers in education and learning. Online Learning has become a crucial component in modern education. Since covid-19 students have had to study from home, online learning was catapulted into mainstream education.We propose that AI is vitalised in the use of online learning. In "Computers and society: modern perspectives" by Ronald M. Baecker, one of the challenges proposed was that online learning proved a disadvantage to students who required more instructions and attention on subjects.What AI will be able to do to communicate with students who need more instructions on the subject without giving the full answer. This ensures students are still able to find answers themselves without giving up due to lack of support. An AI example would be Chat GPT, which was designed to generate responses like those humans would provide, in a text box. However, ChatGPT is not specifically for the use of educational learning. We will be focusing on students from year 8 onwards when students become more independent with their learning.</p>
