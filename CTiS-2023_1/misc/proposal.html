		<td> <em>We will be examining the Impacts of AI on Online learning for Students in this presentation, highlighting how it has the potential to completely transform education in the modern digital age. With the widespread use of digital platforms, artificial intelligence (AI) has become a potent technology that can improve the online learning experience. AI algorithms can offer personalised learning routes that consider each student's unique strengths and learning preferences, promote self-paced learning, and maximise outcomes by analysing enormous volumes of student data. With real-time feedback, adaptive evaluations, and intelligent recommendations, AI-powered tutoring systems mimic human instructors to improve understanding and information retention. By delivering inclusive learning opportunities for students with disabilities or those from disadvantaged backgrounds, AI also offers improved accessibility. Advanced data analytics can help educators learn more about the behaviour, interactions, and preferences of their students, which can then be used to develop curriculum and instruction that is more effective. The creation of interactive and interesting learning materials is also made easier by AI through intelligent content generation. To fully utilise the potential of this technology and create a more inclusive and effective educational system in the digital age, it is essential to comprehend the effects and difficulties of AI in online.</em></td>
