<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

<p>AI learning has the potential transform education by bridging educational gaps and improve access to quality education, especially in remote areas or underserved communities. Online AI courses and virtual learning platforms make it accessible to a broader range of students (UNESCO, 2020). By taking advantage of AI technology, students can overcome locational barriers and participate in learning activities which level the educational difference of low-income areas and developing countries. This includes language barriers; AI chat bots will allow students to ask questions in their language and have it translated across the screen. However, this will require students to obtain a device that can run the AI software. This may prove to be difficult for certain communities and in developing countries, but with the exponential growth in the tech industry this should be an issue of the past soon enough with costs of basic laptops and devices reducing each year.</p>
<p>AI will be able to analyse each student’s data and study their learning habits, strengths, and weaknesses and intuitively adapt accordingly to that specific student. The AI will then be able to create personalised study plans to keep each student up to date on the course material without the student falling behind in class. Each individual student will have their own personalised homework and can be taught based off their data.  An article on ‘TheDataScientist’ says that AI emotion recognition technology will engage students and keep them enthusiastic about developing their learning trends. They’ve also said “The theFacts101 content technology involving AI algorithms allows teachers to create digital textbooks, guides, and coursework. They can change textbook into smart study guide that explains core concepts clearly. The tools create multiple-choice questions that further improve the academic knowledge of young learners.” Applications such as theFacts101 prove that AI can become a crucial component in future education, helping teachers focus their time and skill to better suited tasks.</p>
<p>Overtime, as students become more accustomed to AI and its capabilities, they will begin advancements in its field. AI will soon enough start taking over more rudimentary jobs; therefore, this will direct students into a machine learning or technological role, further advancing the world into a new era of technology. Students will be inspired to develop AI-powered solutions, create start-up, and contribute to technological advancements. This promotes a strong sense of innovation in the coming generations and will drive economic and societal progress in the future.</p>
<p>Comprehensive AI knowledge empowers students to handle societal challenges effectively. AI can be applied to various fields, such as climate change, healthcare, poverty alleviation, and more. By utilizing AI tools and techniques, students can analyse complex data, develop predictive models, and create intelligent systems that contribute to sustainable solutions and improvements in quality of life. However, there is still concern about AI dataset biases, as spoken about in “AI for Social Good” article by NeurIPS Joint Workshop; in which AI will have algorithmic bias. This is a phenomenon that refers to the biases of humans being passed onto the algorithms used in AI. Algorithmic bias can become an issue when dealing with subjects that have more ethical and political material which can indirectly be passed down to students and therefore influence entire generations completely undetected. Although there are ways to combat this such as transparency into dataset biases, it is still uncertain how to detect and measures these biases in datasets/algorithms but with correct policies and education, fostering young minds to make their own opinions and ideologies this can easily be unproblematic.</p>
<p>In summary, incorporating AI technology into education has the potential to transform how we learn and close achievement gaps. It can overcome geographic barriers and give underserved communities access to high-quality education. Platforms and tools with AI capabilities can personalise learning experiences, respond to the needs of individual students, and involve them in their academic journeys. Learning about AI will inspire students to pursue careers in machine learning and technology, which will foster innovation and worldly advancement. Students who are knowledgeable about AI can be better equipped to tackle societal issues like healthcare, poverty alleviation, and climate change. However, worries about algorithmic bias bring to light the significance of openness, regulations, and instruction to guarantee that AI is objective and develops critical thinking in young minds. Overall, AI has the potential opportunity to revolutionise education and equip upcoming generations to improve the world through sustainable solutions and technological advancements.</p>
