<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Throughout the assignment we scheduled 3 different times to meet up and discuss the assignment together and work on it together, every team member kept their promise and was able to come to each meeting and we all were able to come to a group agreement on what to do. Also to keep up with each other we were able to exchange social medias and create a groupchat where we could communicate to each other at home and work through it and help each other.</p>
