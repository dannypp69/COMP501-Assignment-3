<h1>Technology Choices</h1>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) can impact on Online learning in many kinds of ways. Whether the impact is in a good way or not would heavily depend on the choices we the users decide on how to adapt and implement AI into Online learning. Online learning is the delivery of instructions through various multimedia and internet platforms and applications. When we talk about Artificial Intelligence, it is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages. There are already quite a few studies that talk about implementation of Artificial Intelligence into Online learning.</p>
<p>One study talks about developing a gamified AI-enabled online learning application to improve students’ perception of university physics. Cheah, C. W. (2021) introduces the idea of gamification and how it is used to help students learn concepts of university courses that they find difficult to understand like mathematics and physics. This resource covers our point of “Effective AI system design” in which it shows how ITS and gamification develop ways that allow students with low efficiency backgrounds on subjects like mathematics and physics to interact with Artificial Intelligence to increase their knowledge and understanding through game-like pathways or students who don’t have enough interaction with professors, lecturers, or tutors.</p>
<p>But just as it is important to help students learn and study with the help of Artificial Intelligence, it is just as important to remember to maintain a balance between automation and human interaction. Being too reliant on AI could be as equally beneficial as it is non-beneficial. However, with how technology is influencing major aspects of our everyday lives, Artificial Intelligence may also start to have the same impact on learning. Bozkurt et al. (2023) explores the promises and pitfalls of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) AI and potentially future technologies by adopting a speculative methodology. They also thought that now is arguably the best time to define human vs AI contribution to education because Artificial Intelligence has evolved to a level where it can do what was prerogative of human educators. Concluding that it was imperative to rethink the respective roles of technology and human educators in education with a future-oriented mindset.</p>
<p>One thing that should be noteworthy if we plan to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Online learning is ensuring explain ability and transparency. Khosravi et al. (2022) talks about concerns about the Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics (FATE) of educational interventions supported using AI. They mention eXplainable AI (XAI) that promotes the use of methods that produce transparent explanations and reasons for decisions Artificial Intelligence systems make. They go on to present a framework, called XAI-ED, related to explainability for studying, designing, and developing educational AI tools that would consider six key aspects as well as what those key aspects focuses on. It is then followed by four case studies illustrating the applications of XAI-ED in four different educational AI tools and finally concluding their talks by discussing opportunities, challenges and future research needed for the effective implementation of XAI in education.</p>
<p>Another notable aspect to consider is the protection of online learners’ privacy and security when deciding to implement Artificial Intelligence into online learning. Dilmaghani et al. (2019) discuss an overview of existing threats that violate privacy aspects and security issues inflicted by big data as a primary driving force within the AI/ML (machine learning) workflow. Since the increase demand for high-quality AI from government and companies requires the utilization of big data in systems, so too grows the threats on such these systems. Overall, they discuss and investigate the many ways that are taken to lessen the and eliminate the growing concern regarding privacy and security. All things require time for development and improvement, so does the progress of adopting Artificial Intelligence into Online learning.</p>
<p>Continuously evaluating and making improvements to AI for online learning is the one of the last things to consider when implementing Artificial Intelligence into Online Learning. Hentea et al. (2003) explains the difficulties that have arisen through Online Learning which is also known as Distance Learning, and what can be done differently with the use of technology. They discuss that although technology is beneficial but occasionally having face to face interactions with mentors and/or local facilitators is just as important. While finally, mentioning how using Artificial Intelligence on gathering the data of students would help customize their learning experience also offers benefits. Ending that online learning would succeed if it were an organized, consistent program across many disciplines. Such disciplines would include effective educational assessment, student selection, emerging technologies, teacher training and course design.</p>
<p>To conclude, while incorporating AI into online learning has the potential to be beneficial, it is essential to consider the dangers involved and make wise decisions to maximize the efficiency of AI systems and guarantee a positive influence on students' learning experiences.</p>
