<h1>Technology Risks</h1>

<p>There are benefits to using AI-based educational tools more regularly, including feedback, individualised learning, and information availability. However, excessive usage of AI can hinder one's capacity for critical thought and problem-solving. Students would accept preset solutions in the absence of rigors research, which would constrain their uniqueness and innovative ideas. When businesses rely on AI for quick remedies, they are limited in their ability to actively address complex problems and develop innovative ideas. In the classroom, it's critical to maintain a balance between technology use and social connection, as demonstrated by the study by Hwang and Chang (2018). Since human teachers encourage research, conversation, and personalised feedback, they are crucial to fostering critical thinking. To address these difficulties, AI should complement rather than replace traditional educational practises. While using AI as starting points and references, teachers can help students with knowledge analysis, synthesis, and assessment. Striking a balance between technology and freedom of thought is essential. The goal of education should be to foster interpersonal connection, active involvement, and problem-solving skills in order to develop well-rounded capacities for an AI-driven future.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks of online learning AI systems is the challenge of providing individualised feedback because it is challenging to tailor these systems to match the needs of certain students. AI has a hard time understanding different learning methods and providing meaningful feedback beyond correct and wrong answers. The study by Sotiriou et al. (2020) emphasises how important feedback from humans is for enhancing AI-based systems. Teachers use their expertise, intuition, and context awareness to assess student responses, correct mistakes, and address social and emotional needs. In blended learning, the combination of human instruction and AI-generated insights results in a more efficient feedback system. While AI can automate some tasks, like grading, educators must still be active, evaluate the AI's output, and provide customised teaching. Combining AI and human talents enables a thorough and personalised feedback experience. In conclusion, even though AI-based feedback systems have evolved, tailored guidance still needs human input to consider specific demands. By incorporating AI insights into training, instructors may provide students with the benefits of both technology and human aid, enhancing the learning experience.</p>
<p>Accurate question interpretation might be challenging for AI models like Chat GPT, despite being necessary. Misunderstandings and improper responses can be caused by language nuance, a lack of contextual understanding, and complexity. The study by Gao et al. (2019) highlights these challenges and underscores the necessity for ongoing understanding improvement. Enhancements to natural language processing, the addition of external knowledge, and contextual awareness are sought to enhance the performance of AI models. Human input and feedback are necessary for system adjustment and response accuracy evaluation. AI models cannot, however, take the role of human educators who possess subject-matter expertise and pedagogical abilities. AI should be viewed as an adjunct to human instruction, with teachers aiding students in critically examining AI-generated responses. To sum up, it is still challenging to successfully understand student questions, but ongoing research and human expertise aim to enhance AI model comprehension and provide more accurate and applicable answers.</p>
<p>A big educational barrier is the lack of emotional intelligence in AI systems. Similar to human educators, AI finds it difficult to give sophisticated interpersonal communication and sympathetic answers. Empathy and emotional support are two abilities that fall under the category of emotional intelligence and are essential for effective learning. AI lacks emotional awareness and the capacity to recognise and react to pupils' emotions with accuracy. Human teachers can influence student behaviour by providing them with individualised feedback and targeted encouragement, whereas AI frequently uses predefined algorithms and lacks the adaptability needed for individual student motivation. Additionally, empathy is essential because it helps educators foster helpful learning environments. The depth of comprehension and emotional connection are lacking in AI systems, despite the fact that they can simulate empathy to some level. According to research by Amershi, Cakmak, Knox, and Kulesza (2014), human teachers are necessary for inspiring students and fostering empathy and emotional support. Even if AI can do duties like providing feedback and additional resources to human efforts rather than replacing them, it should. Teachers should develop a well-balanced approach to mix the benefits of AI with human sensitivity and emotional intelligence. The negative effects of AI's lack of emotional intelligence on education highlight the importance of considering AI as a tool to support human educators. The cooperative method makes use of AI's advantages while ensuring that students receive the required encouragement and support.</p>
<p>The popularity of online learning and the use of AI in the classroom have generated questions about whether AI systems may eventually replace human teachers. While AI can be very helpful, it will never be able to fully replace human teachers in terms of knowledge, adaptability, and mentoring (Schiff, D., 3.3, 2020). Teachers have unique qualities that are difficult for AI to replicate. They have a strong emotional connection with their students, extensive subject knowledge, and adapt their teaching strategies to each student's needs. Teachers serve as mentors and guides for their students, providing effective criticism and advice on academic matters. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems lack the complexity of human features required for an extensive and personalised learning environment. They excel at handling data processing and automating procedures, but they struggle with complex interactions and personalised support. A balance must be struck between the usage of AI systems and human educators. AI should be used as an additional tool to promote collaboration and co-teaching. Ensuring ethical considerations, human monitoring, and educator professional development is crucial.</p>
<p>Significant advantages such as individualised learning, effective feedback, and increased information access have been gained by integrating AI in education. But worries about AI taking the place of human educators still exist. While AI is a great help, it can't completely replace the qualities and abilities of human teachers. Schiff (2020), Hwang and Chang (2018), Sotiriou et al. (2020), and Gao et al. (2019) have conducted research that emphasise the significance of a balanced strategy that blends AI with traditional teaching techniques. It is difficult for AI systems to imitate human teachers' capacity to nurture traits like critical thinking, flexibility, emotional intelligence, and mentoring. AI systems are excellent at processing data, but they struggle with complex relationships and individualised assistance. Overuse of AI can impair pupils' capacity for critical thought and problem-solving, reducing originality and creativity. AI-generated feedback can fall short in terms of offering thorough and individualised assistance, comprehending various learning styles, and taking social-emotional factors into account. For AI models, accurately comprehending student queries is still a difficulty. Although AI can improve education, it should be seen as a supplement to human teachers rather than a replacement. Students will receive emotional support, individualised feedback, and motivation through a collaborative method that combines AI insights with human supervision. The critical thinking and problem-solving abilities required in an AI-driven future can be fostered by human teachers. It is essential to take ethical issues, human supervision, and educator professional growth into account. We can design a learning environment that maximises student learning results by appreciating the distinctive contributions of human teachers and utilising the promise of AI. In conclusion, while AI has advantages, it can never entirely replace the expertise, adaptability, and mentorship of human teachers. An effective education system that prepares students for the future requires a balanced approach that integrates the advantages of human and artificial intelligence educators.</p>
